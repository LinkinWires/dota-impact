# Dota Impact

An experimental Dota 2 custom game, which tries to implement Genshin Impact characters and mechanics in Dota.

Also serves as a repository of free-to-use code examples for writing a Dota 2 custom game on TypeScript (hope my code isn't that bad).

Don't expect it to have the models or effects, since I, the sole creator, can only code. But if someone, who can port models and particles from Genshin Impact to Dota 2 can help, I would appreciate it!
